* Concepts to Review/Highlight:
** Financial Ratios
** NOPAT---EBIAT
** EVA

#+begin_src C :includes <stdio.h> :exports both
  double NOPAT = 1448;
  double Capital = 9679; /*Capital employed in the business or operation, how does this differ from total assets?*/
  double RONA = NOPAT / Capital; //return on net assets
  double WACC = 0.1272;
  double EVA = (RONA - WACC) * Capital;
  printf("The Economic Value Added is $%.2f\n", EVA);
#+end_src

#+results:
: The Economic Value Added is $216.83

** WACC

$WACC = w_e r_e + w_d r_d (1 - \tau)$

where $w_e$ and $w_d$ is the weight of equity and debt, respectively in the capital structure.  $r_e$ and $r_d$ are the required returns on equity and debt, and $\tau$ is the tax rate.

We can get $r_e$ from the CAPM: $r_e = r_f + \beta_e (r_m - r_f)$ 


* Case and Discussion Questions

1. Have FedEx and UPS achieved their stated goals?
   + Fedex's goal: "superior financial returns".
   + UPS's goal: "long-term competitive return".
2. Can strong performance be expected in the future?
3. What has been the effect of the intense competition between the firms?
4. Which firm would you say is performing "better", and how might we define better?
